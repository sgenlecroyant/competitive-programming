`Competitive programming in action`

<b>
<center>* The motivation behind this repository<center/></b>

---
</br>

1. Make the implementations available in Java so anyone from the Java ecosytem can enjoy the beauty of competitive prgramming in problem-solving, but the language doesn't matter that much as long as you understand the concepts since `Data Structures and Algorithms` are language-agnostic:

2. Learn the PoC of how some data structures are built by following the well-known computer-science concepts as we will move level by level so understanding how `coding challenges` are solved, learn about `Algorithmic Mental Models` like the `Sliding Window Technique`, `Two-pointer, ` and so on, and some advanced `Problem-solving patterns` that we will explore when we reach the famous so-called `Leetcode challenges` so we can solve them efficiently with the most optimal approaches, so this repo is gonna grow as time goes on.
